## Spam Ham Email Classifier 
```
    Used Support Vector Machine Classifier for that.
```

## Steps:
```
   i)  Data Loading and Preprocessing
   ii) Encode labels: ham = 0, spam = 1
   iii) Split Dataset into training and Testing Dataset
   iv) Convert text to TF-IDF features (means converts text to numeric values , because Machine Learning Algorithms like Support Vector Machine Classifier Can not
              Understand Text directly they work with numbers instead).
   v)  Train SVM(Support Vector Machine) Classifier
   vi) Predictions (Predicting Values on the bases of Training Data).
   vii) Evaluations (Finding Accuracy Score ,Classification Report,Confusion Matrix)
```
